Notes on making this code thread safe  
-------------------------------------
The class PaserImpl has been updated to be threasafe safe. The change is very minor,
just use inbuilt Collections.synchronizedList. This is not quite the most 
performant solution (all we really need is a simple stack) but in this case its sufficient.

There is also a unit test, ParallelRunnerTest that behaves as a simple stress test,
repeatedly running multiple threads. 

Please note I also made a few minor tweak to the shell script  to fit with maven.
