Notes on making this code thread safe  
-------------------------------------


The class PaserImpl has been updated to be threasafe safe. In doing this I made a very minor 
change to fix what is really the a limitation in the original design, which is that there is no
clear way to signal when a new group of parsers is being created and hence when to 
reallocate any shared internal storage. This can partially be inferred by the final call to the 
print(PrintStream out) method, but this both unclear and fragile (for instance, what happens if 
an exception occurs).

The interface is unchanged, but the constructor now takes a ParserContext object. This hold the 
date and also the shared, threadsafe list). Thus whenever a new group is created they are guaranteed a 
clean list.

There is also a unit test, ParallelRunnerTest that behaves as a simple stress test,
reapedly running multiple threads.
