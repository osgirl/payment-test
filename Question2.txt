How to make threadsafe
----------------------

A quick solution is to:
  - Make the List<PaymemtRecord> static
  - wrap it in Collections.synchronizedList
  - add a reset() (or suitably named method) to clear the list before starting a load

This makes the list threadsafe on load with probably minimal synchronisation over head. 
This is probably an adequate tweak but has potential hidden side effects (for example
running two counts over different days at the same time).

Threadsafe code is hard to write and even harder to verify. Generally it is 
better to hide this logic within some kind of framework or controller where it can 
be tested in isolation. A pattern that would work well in this case is Map-Reduce, 
where the class is split into two: 

  - One that breaks the file into a list of payment records (the Map part)
  - One that then passes the List and sums the payments(the Reduce part)

This design is far more flexible (for instance different types of 
aggregation can written in the Reduce stage) and pushes the threading knowledge 
into the Map Reduce framework. In this case the framework could be minimal, e.g:
  - Create a thread and Mapper for each file
  - Let all threads run to completion
  - Combine all results (simply append lists from each thread or for
      efficiency create a 'list of list' class) 
  - Run a reducer over the full list.
