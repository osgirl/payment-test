How to make threadsafe
----------------------

A quick solution is to:
  - Make the List<PaymemtRecord> static
  - wrap it in Collections.synchronizedList
  - add a reset() (or suitably named method) to clear the list before starting a load

This makes the list threadsafe on load with probably minimal synchroisation over head. 
This is probably an adequate tweak but has potential hidden side effects (for example
running two counts over different days at the same time)

A better solution is to move to a Map Reduce type design, where the class is split into two: 

  - One that breaks the file into a list of payment records (the Map part)
  - One that hen passes the List and sums  the payments(the Reduce part)

This design is far more flexible and pushes the threading knowledge into the Map Reduce 
framework. In this case the framework would be minimal, e.g:
  - Create a thread and Maapper for each file
  - Let all threads run to completion
  - Combine all results (simply append lists from each thread or for
      efficiency create a 'list of list' class) 
  - Run reducer over the full list.
